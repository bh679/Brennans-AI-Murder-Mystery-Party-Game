#Prompting
 - Prompting is often best done by fastest typer, asking players what they do.
 - Typer is best with a least a little understanding of DM'ing.
 - Actions should be only things withing characters control. Using I statments about me "I walk over there", "I look under the rug"
 - Signficant actions that involve things our of the palayers control should be attempts "I attempt to sink the ship" "I attempt to escape the burning building"
 - You can have intents of thigns out of your control. "I look under the rug, I intend to find treasure"
