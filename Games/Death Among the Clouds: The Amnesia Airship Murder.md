## **Original Prompts & Responses**

### **User Prompt 1:**
Generate 12 players.  
Murder Mystery.  
One of the 12 is the murderer.  
No one knows who (including the murderer). Everyone has amnesia.  
We all have 5 turns (prompts) to guess who did it. Come up with a reason for the timer. Explain in the start. Intro each character. Keep everything very brief and concise.

### **ChatGPT Response 1:**
### **Murder Mystery: Amnesia on the Airship**

#### **Setting:**  
The 12 of you awaken in the luxurious ballroom of a flying airship mid-crash descent. Alarms wail. A mechanical voice blares:  

> **"Self-destruct sequence activated. 5 minutes to impact."**  

None of you remember who you are—or what happened. A body lies on the floor. Someone murdered this person, but no one remembers if they are the killer.  
To disable the self-destruct, you must uncover the murderer in **5 turns**—or all perish.

### **User Prompt 3:**
#### **Player 1:** Wiping sweat off brow and realize the blood on the handkerchief. I look down and see the victim. Who is this person? I look for clues on who they are and how they died. I meow.  
#### **Player 2:** I look around the room for clocks. I feel like I can investigate the clock and get some understanding of the events that took place based on the clock. I check the body for a watch to tell the time of death.  
#### **Player 3:** I call my stockbroker and invest in hydrogen stocks to fund my gambling addiction. I check what type of pirate I am. Aviation or nautical? Something else?  
#### **Player 4:** I make myself a glass of water to calm my nerves. I try to also figure out what type of pirate the guy next to me is.  
#### **Player 5:** Yells for justice and where is my blade??? I demand to see the captain. Who is it? I point at the people covered in blood. That’s strange, not normal. I’m not covered in blood (doesn’t even check if they are).  
#### **Player 6:** I just found this detonator on the dead man.  
#### **Player 7:** I exit the room suspiciously and hide for hours. A cloud of smoke behind me. No one actually sees me leave.  
#### **Player 8:** I accuse someone of the murder while everyone is distracted. I run for the one parachute I’ve stored onboard. Roderick is who I accuse.  
#### **Player 9:** I check if there are knives in the body. (Hopefully not, I was aiming for the captain, I want that parachute).  
#### **Player 10:** I check the gender of the dead body. I think it’s female. I poke it with my cane to check. I also try and steal the parachute before the others.  
#### **Player 11:** I woof. I howl at the moon. Why tonight? Why tonight? I scream!  
#### **Player 12:** I hand the book over to the captain. Hope for an exchange for the parachute.  
#### **Player 13:** I am going to inspect the steering station to see if we can get it back on track.
