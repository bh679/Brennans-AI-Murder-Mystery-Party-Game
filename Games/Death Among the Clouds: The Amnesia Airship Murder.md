# Death Among the Clouds: The Amnesia Airship Murder

## Setting

The 12 of you awaken in the luxurious ballroom of a flying airship mid-crash descent. Alarms wail. A mechanical voice blares:

> **"Self-destruct sequence activated. 5 minutes to impact."** 

None of you remember who you are—or what happened. A body lies on the floor. Someone murdered this person, but no one remembers if they are the killer. To disable the self-destruct, you must uncover the murderer in **5 turns**—or all perish.

## The 13 Characters

1. **Lady Celeste, the Feline Aristocrat** – A humanoid cat with sapphire eyes. Wears a torn ballroom gown. Holds a bloody handkerchief.
2. **Dr. Thatch, the Clockwork Surgeon** – A brass automaton with surgical tools for hands. Bloodstained apron. Logical but twitchy.
3. **Redjack, the Pirate Gambler** – A half-orc sky pirate with a deck of cards and a peg leg. Muttering about being cheated.
4. **Countess Nerida, the Water Mage** – An ethereal elf with water swirling at her fingertips. Her dress is damp. Hands shaking.
5. **Roderick, the Fallen Knight** – A battered knight in tarnished armor. Sword missing. Claims he’ll face justice—if guilty.

7. **Mother Grimm, the Witch** – A hunched old woman with piercing black eyes. Claims the dead body **"reeks of cursed magic."**
8. **Captain Varro, the Skyship Pilot** – A grizzled airship captain clutching a navigation wheel fragment. “This isn’t my fault… is it?”
9. **Lila, the Dancer with Knives** – A tiefling in tattered silks. Hidden throwing knives. Murmurs, *“Did I aim for the right one?”*
10. **Jasper, the Masked Noble** – A mysterious noble with a silver mask and a cracked, jewel-encrusted cane.
11. **Veyra, the Beast-Blooded Ranger** – A hulking woman with wolf-like features. Blood streaks her claws. “Was I… hunting?”
12. **Silas, the Scholar of Shadows** – A human in dark robes. Holding a book titled **"How to Erase Guilt."**

- **Lady Celeste** dramatically inspects the **boot print**. **“And two makes a pair,”** she purrs, scanning the room. **Roderick stiffens.**
- **Dr. Thatch** opens the **locket**—a faded **portrait of Captain Varro with the victim.** Engraved: *“Together we rise.”*

## **Final Turn: Betrayals, Deaths, & The Killer Revealed**

- **Lady Celeste** builds an **escape pod** out of the ship’s mast.
- **Dr. Thatch** accuses **Roderick** of loving the victim.
- **Roderick**, confused, throws his **peg-leg pirate friend's appendix** into the **locket** before **leaping to his death.**
- **Redjack** waterboards Captain Varro again—until **the captain finally cracks.**
- **Countess Nerida** **summons a giant water hand** to catch the ship.
- **Veyra** howls, **ripping a hole in the ship** before **diving out.**
- **Lila** resets the **detonator timer**—buying them time.
- **Silas** suddenly grips the wheel. “Justice, in the end.”

### **The Truth**
Captain Varro **sabotaged the ship** to fake an accident, **inheriting Lady Althea’s fortune.** When she confronted him, he **slit her throat.** The **locket** revealed their connection. The **boot print matched his size.** The **sabotaged ship controls** bore **his name.**

Silas smirks. **“It was you, Captain.”**

**Lady Celeste** shoves **Varro overboard.** He **plummets to his death.**

> **"Self-destruct aborted."**
