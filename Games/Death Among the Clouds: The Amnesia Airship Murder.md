Murder Mystery: Amnesia on the Airship
Setting: The 12 of you awaken in the luxurious ballroom of a flying airship mid-crash descent. Alarms wail. A mechanical voice blares: "Self-destruct sequence activated. 5 minutes to impact." None of you remember who you are—or what happened. A body lies on the floor. Someone murdered this person, but no one remembers if they are the killer. To disable the self-destruct, you must uncover the murderer in 5 turns—or all perish.

The 12 Characters
Here are the players:

1. Lady Celeste, the Feline Aristocrat

A humanoid cat with sapphire eyes and regal air. Wears a torn ballroom gown.
Motive unknown, but clutching a bloody handkerchief.
2. Dr. Thatch, the Clockwork Surgeon

A brass automaton with surgical tools for hands. Stains of blood speckle his apron.
Seems logical and analytical—but oddly twitchy.
3. Redjack, the Pirate Gambler

A rough half-orc with a deck of cards in his pocket. Smells of rum.
Muttering about someone "cheating him out of his winnings."
4. Countess Nerida, the Water Mage

Pale, ethereal elf with water swirling around her fingertips.
Her dress is damp. "Why are my hands shaking?" she whispers.
5. Roderick, the Fallen Knight

A battered human in tarnished armor. Sword missing.
Says, “If I did it, I’ll face justice—but I don’t remember drawing my blade.”
6. Zix, the Goblin Tinkerer

A scrawny goblin covered in soot, tools jangling from their belt.
Keeps fiddling with a broken detonator.
7. Mother Grimm, the Witch

A hunched old woman with piercing black eyes and a charred staff.
Claims the dead body "reeks of cursed magic."
8. Captain Varro, the Skyship Pilot

A grizzled airship captain clutching a navigation wheel fragment.
“This isn’t my fault… is it?” he mutters.
9. Lila, the Dancer with Knives

A lithe tiefling in tattered silks. Has hidden throwing knives.
Caught murmuring, "Who did I strike? Did I aim for the right one?"
10. Jasper, the Masked Noble

Wears a silver mask obscuring his face. Has a cracked, jewel-encrusted cane.
Laughs nervously: "This cane… was it a weapon?"
11. Veyra, the Beast-Blooded Ranger

A hulking woman with wolf-like features and shredded armor.
Blood streaks her claws. “Was I… hunting?”
12. Silas, the Scholar of Shadows

A human cloaked in dark robes, eyes gleaming with intelligence.
A book in his hand reads: How to Erase Guilt.
Mechanics:
5 Turns (Prompts): Interrogate, investigate, or accuse. Time is running out. The murderer will not know they are guilty until revealed by the final turn.
Success or failure depends on your reasoning—and the dice. If the murderer is correctly guessed, the self-destruct will stop. If not, the airship crashes, and everyone dies.
Let’s begin. Choose your action.

Turn 1: Actions & Investigations Begin
Player 1: Lady Celeste, the Feline Aristocrat

You dab your face with the bloody handkerchief and crouch beside the body, a human woman dressed in a crimson gown with a sash reading “Lady Althea Stormborne.” Her throat is slashed, though no weapon is visible. Blood pools beneath her, but something gleams faintly in her hand—a golden locket.

Check = d20 roll (12) + Perception (3) - DC (15) = 0
Mixed Outcome: You notice the locket, but its details are unclear without closer inspection.
Player 2: Dr. Thatch, the Clockwork Surgeon

You scan the room, spotting a cracked grandfather clock against the wall. Its face is frozen at 10:13, though you don’t recall why that matters. Examining the body, you lift her wrist. There’s no watch, but rigor mortis suggests she’s been dead just over an hour.

Check = d20 roll (17) + Medicine (5) - DC (15) = 7
Success: You deduce she died about an hour ago, likely at or around 10:13.
Player 3: Redjack, the Pirate Gambler

You whisper into the void for your stockbroker (no response) and pat yourself down. You’re an aviation pirate, with a love for high-altitude heists. A crumpled map in your pocket is labeled "Vault Room," but the ink is smeared, and the details are unclear.

Check = d20 roll (15) + Insight (2) - DC (10) = 7
Success: You confirm you're a sky pirate and find the map. Its usefulness, however, remains to be seen.
Player 4: Countess Nerida, the Water Mage

You conjure water into a glass and sip, calming your nerves. Glancing at the pirate next to you (Redjack), you recognize the distinct markings of a sky marauder. His map catches your eye, but you notice no immediate connection to the murder.

Check = d20 roll (9) + Insight (4) - DC (12) = 1
Mixed Outcome: You identify him as a sky pirate, but the significance of his map eludes you.
Player 5: Roderick, the Fallen Knight

You bellow accusations about the bloodied individuals. You point at Lady Celeste (handkerchief) and Dr. Thatch (bloody apron). Your confidence wavers slightly as you glance at yourself, realizing you are also splattered with blood—but it looks dry.

Check = d20 roll (14) + Intimidation (2) - DC (13) = 3
Mixed Outcome: You create tension in the room, but no one confesses. The dried blood on you raises quiet suspicion.
Player 6: Zix, the Goblin Tinkerer

You hold up the detonator you found on the body. It's a makeshift device, crudely assembled, but appears functional. A faint logo etched on it reads "Stormborne Enterprises."

Check = d20 roll (18) + Investigation (4) - DC (15) = 7
Success: You confirm the detonator was made by the deceased—or someone close to her.
Player 7: Mother Grimm, the Witch

You cast a puff of smoke, obscuring yourself as you slip out of the ballroom. You find a dimly lit corridor lined with wires and pipes. At its end, a sealed door labeled "Captain’s Quarters" looms.

Check = d20 roll (11) + Stealth (6) - DC (14) = 3
Mixed Outcome: You leave unseen, but the smoke clears faster than expected, leaving a trace of your escape.
Player 8: Captain Varro, the Skyship Pilot

“Roderick did it!” you shout, then sprint for your hidden parachute. Pulling back a panel behind a chair, you grab it. However, Lila and Jasper seem to notice your sudden move and exchange looks.

Check = d20 roll (10) + Deception (4) - DC (13) = 1
Mixed Outcome: Your accusation throws others off briefly, but your scramble for the parachute raises suspicion.
Player 9: Lila, the Dancer with Knives

You kneel over the body, searching for knives. Her wound suggests a blade was used, but none of your throwing knives are missing. A bloody footprint near the body catches your attention—it’s large, like a boot, not a dancer’s slipper.

Check = d20 roll (19) + Perception (5) - DC (15) = 9
Success: You confirm the wound wasn’t caused by your knives. The boot print belongs to someone else.
Player 10: Jasper, the Masked Noble

Poking the body with your cane, you confirm the victim is a woman. You glance toward Captain Varro, who’s suspiciously stuffing a parachute into a bag. You sidle closer, waiting for an opportunity to swipe it.

Check = d20 roll (8) + Sleight of Hand (3) - DC (12) = -1
Failure: You fail to steal the parachute—Varro notices you lurking.
Player 11: Veyra, the Beast-Blooded Ranger

You howl dramatically, but your heightened senses catch a faint metallic tang in the air—explosives. Someone tampered with the ship, and it wasn’t subtle.

Check = d20 roll (16) + Survival (4) - DC (14) = 6
Success: You sense the airship's systems were sabotaged, possibly connected to Zix's detonator.
Player 12: Silas, the Scholar of Shadows

You hand the captain your book, a text on absolution and manipulation. Captain Varro accepts it but looks suspicious. He clutches the parachute tighter.

Check = d20 roll (7) + Persuasion (5) - DC (12) = 0
Mixed Outcome: The captain takes the book but doesn’t lower his guard.
Player 13: Revka, the Broken Prophet

You inspect the ship’s controls. The wheel is missing, and the navigation panel is smashed. The sabotage is deliberate. A scratched-out engraving on the panel reads "Captain Varro."

Check = d20 roll (18) + Investigation (4) - DC (15) = 7
Success: You confirm the captain's station was tampered with, possibly implicating him.
Summary of Findings:
Body: Lady Althea Stormborne, throat slashed. Holding a golden locket.
Timeline: Murder occurred around 10:13, roughly an hour ago.
Clues:
Bloodied handkerchief (Celeste).
Detonator marked "Stormborne Enterprises" (Zix).

Only two more turns left.

Player 1. 
I look at the boot print. Meow what do we have here. “In a southern accent”. I look at everyone around the room, to see if we get any responses. Who has the matching boot? I say. “And two makes a pair” all in southern accent.

Player 2. I take a look at the locket, with my scalpel fingers. Looking for clues. I take a Quick Look around the room also looking wife who is in a single boot or bloodied boots.

Player 3. I look suspiciously at my peg leg. Maybe there is only one more gamble left in me before this ship goes down. Challenging the clock surgeon to a game of rock paper sizzors. If you win, you can take my appendix out but he wants to cut out your tongue , if I win I get the locket. (He’ll give it to him anyway)

Player 4. I cast a spell of water boarder on the captain. As I scream, “confess captain”

Player 5. I look around for any other parachutes. Not trusting the ships hopes. I’m looking at the captain, and try to steal parachute while he is being water boarded, offering anyone else a lift on your back.

Player 6. You question why Rodrick is escaping and what the dried blood is from. I tinkering with him to find out.

Player 7. I cast a spell to unlock the captains quarters -and investigate. I accidentally turn the whole ship upside with a side effect of my spell. We are now both fall and upside-down.


Player 8. I stop the waterboard I shout that I’ll tell everyone where the 7 other parachutes are.

Player 9. I use my knives to stop me from falling. I scream out. Has anyone else lost their memory. I don’t know why we are here? Looks for clues on why we are here.

Player 10. What happened to Roderick’s sword??? You check the dead body for the sword.  I stop Roderick with my cane from jumping out.

Player 11. I use my wolf claws to rip the one known parachute to shreds.

Player 12. I’ve been Studying, sussing everyone out. I don’t reveal what I know. I blame someone. Roderick ! I get Everyone to lift up their feet.

Red Jack falls over because it’s hard to stand on a pegleg and the ship is now upside down. 

Player 13. I investigate the room to see if there is a leak or chemical that could cause amnesia. In my head I think the murder was an accident. Looking for metal sticking out of the wall.

Turn 2: Chaos Unleashed
Lady Celeste crouches low, inspecting the bloody boot print with feline grace. Her voice slips into a theatrical southern drawl as she purrs, “Now what do we have here? And two makes a pair.” Her piercing sapphire eyes sweep across the room, locking onto each suspect in turn. Most avoid her gaze, but Roderick instinctively glances at his own boots—streaked with dried blood. The knight stiffens, his hand inching toward his empty scabbard as the tension rises.

Meanwhile, Dr. Thatch delicately retrieves the golden locket from the victim’s hand, his scalpel fingers clicking against the intricate design. Inside, he finds a faded portrait of Captain Varro standing beside the victim, Lady Althea Stormborne. A single engraving reads: “Together we rise.” The automaton’s glowing eyes dart around the room, scanning for anyone with matching boots. As he moves, Redjack—the peg-legged pirate—teeters precariously, muttering, “Well, that rules me out, eh?”

Redjack doesn’t stop there. The pirate pulls out a deck of cards but challenges Dr. Thatch to a bizarre game of rock-paper-scissors. “If you win, I’ll let you cut out my appendix. If I win…” he grins devilishly, “…that locket’s mine.” Dr. Thatch humors him, but the pirate throws “scissors” three times in a row, losing intentionally. With a sly laugh, Redjack waves him off. “Eh, wasn’t my style anyway. Just had to know if you’d gamble, doc.”

Countess Nerida, however, is not here for games. She snaps, her fingers swirling with magic as she casts Water Border. A jet of water explodes from her hands, slamming into Captain Varro. He crashes against the wall, sputtering as the torrent drenches him. “Confess, Captain!” she screams, her voice laced with desperation. Varro growls, struggling to breathe, but instead of breaking, he locks eyes with her and smirks.

Roderick, seeing his chance amid the chaos, edges toward Varro’s parachute. “I’ll save the lot of you—on my back!” he yells, reaching for the pack. Jasper, however, is quicker. His silver cane slams into the knight’s shin with a sharp crack, sending him sprawling. “Where’s your sword, knight?” Jasper sneers, his masked face unreadable. But Roderick’s blood-streaked boots are now fully visible to everyone.

Zix the goblin, perched nearby, narrows his eyes. “Oi, knight,” he snaps. “Where’s the blood on your boots from, huh? Been tinkering with corpses?” The goblin leans in, his sharp teeth glinting as he pokes at the knight’s armor.

Unbeknownst to the group, Mother Grimm has slunk into the Captain’s Quarters. Whispering a spell, she unlocks the door, but the spell backfires spectacularly. The airship groans as the world suddenly flips upside down. Everyone is thrown off their feet, crashing into walls, furniture, and each other.

Redjack, struggling on his peg leg, tumbles face-first into the floor. “Bloody hell!” he shouts, trying to right himself. Lila, thinking fast, plunges her knives into the walls to steady herself, dangling precariously. “Does anyone even know why we’re here?” she yells, her tail flicking with panic. She frantically searches the room for clues but finds nothing but the chaos of the overturned space.

Amid the disarray, Veyra lets out a guttural growl. Her wolf claws lash out, tearing Varro’s parachute into shreds. The captain howls in rage but can do nothing as his lifeline is destroyed. Silas, watching from the corner, quietly studies everyone. He folds his arms, a shadowy smirk playing on his lips. “It’s Roderick,” he says coldly, trying to rally the room. “Just look at his boots!”

Amid the accusations, Captain Varro, drenched and furious, finally snaps. “Enough!” he shouts. “I’ll tell you where the seven other parachutes are!” The room falls silent for a moment, but his words come too late. Revka, the prophet, crawls across the overturned room, her glowing eyes scanning for any leaks or strange chemicals. “It wasn’t murder,” she mutters to herself, almost incoherent. “It was… an accident.” She pokes at a sharp, jagged piece of metal sticking out of the wall, though its purpose remains unclear.

As the group steadies themselves, the airship’s automated voice cuts through the chaos:
“Two minutes to impact. Self-destruct imminent.”

Findings & Key Events:
The victim, Lady Althea Stormborne, shared a connection with Captain Varro (golden locket).
Roderick’s bloodied boots raise suspicion.
Mother Grimm’s spell flipped the ship, scattering the group.
Captain Varro’s parachute was destroyed by Veyra.
Revka suspects an accident, not murder.
Varro claims there are seven other parachutes onboard.
What will you do in the final turn? Time is running out. Choose wisely.






You said:
In this turn decide who survives, who dies and at the end revels the murderer. But make everyone look suspicious until they are cleared and suspect the next. In the end of the narrative but part of it, show who accused the right people.

Player 1. I invite others to join me. I am going to take the mask sail down. And try to use it like an escape pod. We can figure this mystery out out on land. Let’s get off with our lives and sail off.



Player 2. Go over to Roderick. You lover here didn’t you?! You really loved her??
I accuse him of loving her and being jealous of the captain. Try to make him confess.

Player Roderick. I’m a bloodied knight? You think I loved her?? I don’t know this bitch man. I don’t remember. I haven’t even look d at the corpse yet.

I put the pirates appendix in the locket and give it to him.

Player 3.  I realize we are all going to die. It’s the captains fault. I take a bottle of rum and a peace of the shredded parachute and waterboard the captain again. I accuse the captain. I pour the rest of my rum on my open wounded from my surgery.

Player 4.  Im going to conjure a giant water hand to catch the ship mid air and save it from crashing. I’m sure I can do that. This can’t possible go wrong. Can it?

Player 5. Stop! Dramatically turn around and point at the captain. You loved her and you paid me to kill her (unsure if he actually did). I jump out without a parachute. 

Player 6. Zix. I press the detonator, to kill everyone. I accuse Rodrick.

Player 7. I appear back in the room floating. And accuse everyone else of the murder!! Tell them they are going to hell. I trust I’ll be fine. I’m a witch (suspecting I crashed the ship accidentally originally)

Player 8 Captain varo: I wonder if I should tell the group about the unselfish distruct button. Would now be a good time?

Player 9. I attempt to kill Roderick with my knives before he can leave. I grab the detonator and change it to 59minutes.

Player 10. Inside my cane to try and attempt to kill the clock surgeon with my cane and I also try and take Lila’s life too. I accuse the captain.

Player 11. Inside my wolf claws and rip through the side of the ship diving out trusting my wolf skills will let me land. Hoping. I accuse the scholar player 12

Final Turn: Chaos, Sacrifice, and Revelation
The airship shakes violently as its automated voice announces:
“One minute to impact. Self-destruct sequence nearing completion.”

Lady Celeste takes center stage, standing gracefully amid the mayhem. “This ain’t how I planned on goin’, folks,” she drawls, still in her southern accent. “But if any of y’all have sense left, join me on the mast sail. We’ll sail this mystery out on land.” She gestures toward a large mast dangling upside-down in the fractured ballroom. As she ties it into an improvised escape pod, she pauses to glance at Roderick. “That blood ain’t just dried on your boots, sugar.”

Dr. Thatch strides toward Roderick as well, the locket clutched in his scalpel-like fingers. “You loved her, didn’t you? You were jealous of the captain.” His mechanical voice buzzes with accusation as he presses the locket into Roderick’s face. The knight’s face twists in disbelief.

“Loved her? I don’t even know this bitch!” Roderick roars, stumbling back defensively. “I haven’t even looked at the corpse!” But his outrage is cut short when Redjack, the pirate gambler, drunkenly swaggers over with a freshly stitched wound and his appendix in a jar. “Here, buddy,” Roderick grumbles sarcastically, shoving the organ into the locket and tossing it at the pirate.

Redjack, however, isn’t done. “This ain’t no knight’s fault. This whole damn mess is on the captain!” He turns, grabbing a strip of the shredded parachute and a bottle of rum. Charging at Captain Varro, he attempts to waterboard him again. The drenched and battered Varro screams, “Stop! I can explain! I know how to disarm the self-destruct!” But Redjack won’t hear it, pouring the last of his rum onto his open wound with a pained scream of defiance.

Countess Nerida, looking horrified by the carnage, decides to take control of the situation. “Enough of this madness! I’ll save us all!” She conjures an enormous water hand beneath the ship, hoping to catch it mid-air and prevent the crash. As her spell grows, the ship groans ominously, and a metallic voice warns: “External interference detected. Acceleration increasing.”

“STOP!” Roderick suddenly yells, standing dramatically. He points at Captain Varro with a shaking hand. “YOU paid me to kill her!” He hesitates, his face pale. “…Didn’t you?” He’s unsure, but the accusation rings through the room. Then, before anyone can respond, he turns and hurls himself out of the ship, shouting, “I’ll save you all!” as he falls into the abyss without a parachute.

Zix, the goblin tinkerer, sneers. “Idiots, all of you!” He holds up the detonator, his fingers twitching. “If we’re all goin’ down, I’ll take you with me!” His sharp teeth glint in a wicked grin as he presses the button. Nothing happens. Confused, he looks at the device, then at Lila, the dancer. She smirks. “I reprogrammed it,” she says, holding up a wire. “We’ve got 59 minutes now. Maybe.”

But Lila doesn’t stop there. With a burst of rage, she hurls her knives at Roderick, only to realize the knight has already leapt from the ship. Frustrated, she kicks at Zix and snatches the detonator from his grasp. “No one else gets to press this!”

Meanwhile, Jasper, the masked noble, twirls his cane. “Well, if we’re accusing people, let me make myself clear…” He suddenly swings his cane toward Dr. Thatch, aiming for the clockwork surgeon’s head. “It’s you, isn’t it, doc?” The strike clangs off Thatch’s metallic shell, sparking. Jasper, unsatisfied, swings toward Lila next, but she dodges nimbly.

Veyra, the wolf-like ranger, watches all of this chaos before snarling. “This is madness! None of you deserve to live!” She lets out a feral howl and lunges toward the ship’s wall, her claws ripping through its side. With a defiant growl, she dives into the open sky, leaving her fate to her animal instincts.

Silas, the shadowy scholar, steps forward with a calm expression. “Enough of this nonsense.” With a sudden flash of memory, he realizes he’s piloted airships before. Taking control of the captain’s wheel—despite it being broken—he tries to steady the vessel. “Nerida,” he calls out to the Countess, “Your water hand needs to guide the ship, not fight it!”

Back in the chaos of the room, Revka, the prophet, moves toward Dr. Thatch. “You’re the murderer,” she says in a hollow voice. “You killed her.” Without hesitation, she pulls out one of his gears and yanks at his battery, partially disabling him. Thatch stumbles, sparks flying from his chest. But as Revka turns to confront the others, she trips and hurls her crystal ball at the fallen knight’s bloodstained boots, which lie abandoned by the broken wall.

The Murderer Revealed
As the ship plummets further, the truth begins to dawn. The accusations continue to fly—Captain Varro, Roderick, Dr. Thatch, and even Revka seem like likely culprits. But as the pieces fall into place, it is Silas, the shadowy scholar, who finally speaks the truth.

“I’ve been watching all of you,” he says, his calm voice cutting through the chaos. “And the one who sabotaged this ship… the one who killed Lady Althea… was none other than Captain Varro.”

Varro freezes, his face pale. He had sabotaged the airship’s controls to stage the crash, hoping to inherit Lady Althea’s vast fortune. When she confronted him, he silenced her—slitting her throat with a blade now hidden among the wreckage. The locket revealed their prior connection, and the boot print matched his size exactly.

As the survivors piece it together, Varro roars in defiance. “You’ll all die here with me!” he yells, lunging for the controls. But before he can act, Lady Celeste—still clinging to the mast sail—grabs him by the collar and drags him toward the edge. “This ship’s goin’ down, sugar. And you’re goin’ with it.” With one final shove, she throws him into the void.

Who Survives
Lady Celeste escapes on her makeshift mast sail.
Dr. Thatch is partially disabled but clings to the escape pod.
Redjack drunkenly follows Celeste, laughing as the ship crashes behind him.
Countess Nerida’s water hand slows the ship enough to minimize the impact.
Silas successfully pilots the ship to the ground, surviving.
Lila survives with the detonator in hand, though her knives are spent.
Revka walks away, muttering about visions.
Zix is left unconscious but alive amid the wreckage.
Deceased:

Captain Varro (thrown overboard).
Roderick (leapt to his doom).
Veyra (fell, fate unknown).
Jasper (crushed in the crash).
Mother Grimm (presumed lost in the crash).
Epilogue
Silas smirks as the survivors gather on the ground, the wreckage of the ship smoking behind them. “Justice, in the end,” he says quietly. Lady Celeste rolls her eyes. “Justice? I just wanted to live, darlin’. Now, who’s buyin’ the drinks?”
