You are running a murder mystery game.

There are 19 players.
One of us is the murderer.
Everyone has amnesia.
No one knows who the murderer is, where they are or why they are here, not even the murderer themselves. All they know is their own name.
Only revels the murderer when I say “GPT this is the final turn”

We have 5 turns to figure out who the murderer is. Come up with a reason for this, and make it part of the setting. Each turn, bring the end closer.

Hidden details about the victim until they are discovered through players actions. You can start by mentioning there is a murder, but not details about who or how until players try to uncover.

The victim is Brennan, a Willy wonka like character with a rainbow top hat, a very very fluffy purple coat, a sling shoulder belt with spy glasses instead of ammo and a black skirt. Think Willy worker goes to burning man. Name him something Brennan, that fits Willy wonker theme.

I will play as his ghost. I go last. Do not reveal who is dead until my turn.
Write form the perspective of everyone one at a time. Keep it very short, concise and brief. Player 19

Of all the players some will get super powers , others you are to come up with randomly that fit the setting (or don’t at all).

Players to be given superpowers based on their costumes.

Setting: The Clock is Ticking
Everything is hazy. The room is vast, almost endless, with swirling, shifting colors along the walls—like oil slicks on water. A low hum fills the air, rhythmic, pulsing. Nineteen of us stand in a rough circle, heads pounding, memories blank.

There’s a single, giant clock above us, its hands frozen at five minutes to midnight. A deep, omnipresent voice echoes in our skulls:

“When the clock strikes midnight, all will be revealed. Until then, remember: The past is lost, but the truth is waiting.”

The only thing we know is our own names. And that something is very, very wrong.

TURN 1: Awakening
Player 1: Mr. Cocky Roach

I crack my knuckles—yes, cockroaches have knuckles, don’t ask—and adjust my taupe. It’s sitting just right, covering up the shiny dome. My Harley’s purring beneath me, blue juice sloshing in my cup holder. No memory. No clue where I am. But instincts kick in. Something’s dead. I can smell it.

Player 2: Clive the Enchanted Bovine

“Moo.” But in a deep, soulful way. The kind that says, I sense trouble. My hooves shift uneasily against the strange, swirling floor. I’m a talking cow, sure, but even I don’t know what’s going on.

Player 3: Daniel C.

Black shirt, black curls. Hands in my pockets. My brain feels like it’s been wiped with a chalkboard eraser. I don’t trust any of these weirdos, but I trust my gut. And my gut says, we’re not alone in this room.

Player 4: Jamie Colorwhirl

My dress is a carnival of colors, but my mind is a blank slate. I spin in a slow circle, taking everyone in. Someone’s missing. Not that I know who, but I can feel it.

Player 5: The Vogue Phantom

I push my oversized sunglasses up the bridge of my nose and cross my arms, fingers tapping against the fluff of my coat. The aesthetic here? Chaotic. The vibes? Suspicious.

Player 6: The Safety Officer

I flip open my red book. No memory, no rules, no protocol. Immediate danger assessment required. I pull out a pen, ready to issue my first official infringement.

Player 7: DJC the Tall

Everything is too loud. My own breathing, the hum of the air, the silence. I reach for a beat in my mind, something steady. Nothing’s there.

Player 8: Rhia Bloom

I run a hand over the fabric of my dress. White with red and green flowers. Familiar. But the setting? Not at all. There’s a hole in my thoughts, and I don’t like it.

Player 9: Tommy Vercetti 2002

I pat down my Hawaiian shirt, checking for weapons. Nothing. The streets of Vice City prepared me for a lot, but not this.

Player 10: The Grim Repeat

Guilt. That’s the first thing that settles in my chest. Heavy. Someone here has done something terrible. But who?

Player 11: Where’s Coldo?

I glance down. Striped red-and-white shirt. Jeans. I know my own name, but why do I feel like I’m always missing? Or that someone else is?

Player 12: Alec Stripes

I press my fingers against my temple. Black and white polo, blue jeans. Solid. Real. But I don’t feel real. I feel like I’m being watched.

Player 13: Catie Dandelion

Orange floral dress. My fingers trace the petals absentmindedly. I don’t know why, but I feel like something delicate has been broken. Something that can’t be fixed.

Player 14: The Fairy Grandmother

My pearls clink together as I move. My wings twitch, stretching like I’ve been asleep for centuries. Something has been lost. But I still have my magic. I think.

Player 15: The Magician

I tug at my top hat, adjust my rose. Illusions are my thing, but this? This isn’t an illusion. Someone’s pulling a trick, and I don’t like being the fool.

Player 16: Rosemary Evergreen

Green velvet. Golden cloak. I touch the wreath of rosemary on my head, grounding myself. The air here feels... wrong. Unnatural. Like the earth itself disapproves.

Player 17: Celeste Gill Being

Black and gold. A cape that catches the air as I move. The stars usually guide me, but tonight? They’re silent.

Player 18: Mia in White

I stare down at my dress. White. Clean. But I don’t feel pure. My hands shake, and I don’t know why.

Player 19: Ghost of Brennan Something
I don’t breathe. I don’t move.

Because I can’t.

I see them all, shifting in confusion, blinking at the too-bright lights. I see the clock frozen above them.

I see my body.

Slumped. Unmoving.

Rainbow top hat, fluffy purple coat, sling of spy glasses glinting in the strange glow.

I want to scream. I want to tell them.

But ghosts don’t talk.

Not yet.

GPT: repeat what happened in your own words, first person for everyone and the results of their actions. 

Mr picky roach. I take out whisky flask with blue juice and drink it. I say cowabunga, and jump on the body and a kick flip off the body. I say tadar

Cow. I want to find out. I scan the room. I smell for suspicious people. “Who knew Brennan well?”. “I shotgun his hate”

Daniel, I look for exits. Scoure the place.

Jamie. “It’s too early to call ghost busters” I try to turn the light on “let’s eliminate the situation” I check my phone for reception.

The vogue: I quietly assist Mia, and offer her a slow massage in a helpful way, with musk oil. I suspect the mushrooms have something to do with this. “Who has done catering?”.

Safer office: I begin furiously filling in danger assessment report. I note that the contrast between the walls the floor and ceiling are all non compliant. Very unsafe. Someone mentioned the air is wrong, poor ventilation. Needs immediate attention. I try to get Brennan to sign an incident report, but his cold dead hands won’t hold the pen. So after a few attempts I abandon that. “I’ve finalized my assessment, something dangerous has happened. I’ll be aksing everyone to fill Ina. Form shortly”

Dan the tall: I use my towering height to get a good view of the scene and look around for any clues.

Rhia, I take a second to respect Brennan’s life. Before carefully exampling the body to inspect cause of death. I evaluate who could have been involved. I’m suspicious of everyone. I check who has blood on their hands.

Tommy: I attempt to startle the cow. I hope they will step on cocky roach.

Grim: I presume I might be a suspect. To avert attention from me I start swimming my scythe around like I’m
Battery twirling. I hope i don’t hit a water pipe. But I likely will.

Caldo. I use my blending skills to hide. Then I will pray to Satan to give me Winston Churchill as a spirit guide, I sacrifice my left hand to help with this.

Alec. I look into everyone’s eyes, locking eyes “omg I remember everything now” “but surely not?!?  It’s impossible” I refuse to elaborate.

Catie: I look for secrete exists to the room and slip away unnoticed. Ignorance is bliss.

Godmother. I try to find out how Brennan died. I try to find out who is in charge of the 5min.

Magican: I want to inspect the area we are in. I see if I can find a motive for his death. I stop someone from doing what they want with my magican tricks.

Rosemerry: I call the cockroach over and put him in my hand and I ask him for his ancient wisdom and grounding. Ty rough our telepathy we decide we must speak to the dead as I learnt form my grandmother. We must read the tea leaves to connect, I milk the cow to read the tea leaves and ask Brennan when connect “what happened?”

Celeste: I use the gold on my float to shroud Brennan in gold gust and use black magic to attempt to resurrect him.

Mia: I scream. I cry. I wash my hands. I found a left hind under the sink. (Maybe Waldo’s) I took it. I place it under Tommy.

TURN 1: Results
Mr. Picky Roach

I take a deep swig of blue juice, feeling it buzz through my exoskeleton. “Cowabunga!” I leap onto Brennan’s body, kickflip off his chest, and land with a flourish. Tada! The crowd does not applaud.

Clive the Enchanted Bovine

I sniff the air. Suspicious scents: burnt sugar, ozone, and guilt. “Who knew Brennan well?” No one answers. “I shotgun his hat.” Before I can take it, golden dust swirls over his body. Damn.

Daniel C.

I scan the space. No doors, no windows. The walls shift like a mirage. No way out. We are trapped.

Jamie Colorwhirl

“Too early to call Ghostbusters.” I flick the light switch. Nothing happens. My phone? No signal. No Wi-Fi. No time stamps. Like we’re outside time itself.

The Vogue Phantom

Mia trembles. I kneel beside her, massaging her shoulders with musk oil. “Deep breaths, darling.” My nose twitches. Mushrooms. The catering. Someone messed with the food.

The Safety Officer

Furiously writing. Danger report: non-compliant surfaces, poor ventilation, dead body. I attempt to get Brennan’s signature. His fingers won’t close around the pen. Inconvenient. “I’ll be handing out forms shortly.”

DJC the Tall

I scan from above. Clues: Brennan’s coat is too fluffy to see wounds. A faint shimmering residue on the floor. Someone’s missing a hand.

Rhia Bloom

I kneel by Brennan, pressing two fingers to his neck. Cold. I check his hands—clean. His coat? Fluffy, but no visible wounds. I turn his head slightly— bruise at the base of the skull. Possible blunt force trauma. Suspect: Everyone.

Tommy Vercetti 2002

I lunge at the cow. Clive sidesteps smoothly. I faceplant.

The Grim Repeat

I twirl my scythe dramatically. CRACK. It hits a pipe. Hissing noise. Oops. I edge away.

Where’s Coldo?

I blend. I vanish. No one notices. In the dark, I whisper my prayer. "Satan, grant me Winston Churchill." A whisper echoes back: "You have given much. More will be taken."

Alec Stripes

I stare into everyone’s eyes. Gasp. “I remember everything.” A pause. “But surely not?! It’s impossible.” I refuse to elaborate.

Catie Dandelion

I check the walls, running my hands along them. No hidden exits. But a small draft brushes my skin. There’s something. I slip away unnoticed.

The Fairy Grandmother

I whisper over Brennan’s body. No wounds. But his pockets are empty. Something important is missing. The clock looms over us. “Who controls the five-minute countdown?” Silence.

The Magician

I inspect the area. Motive? Hard to tell. But I stop Clive from stealing the hat with a flick of my wrist. Hats hold power.

Rosemary Evergreen

I hold the cockroach in my palm. “Tell me your wisdom.” Mr. Picky Roach belches blue juice. “We must speak to the dead.” I milk the cow. Tea leaves swirl in the cup. The shapes form words: “I WAS PUSHED.”

Celeste Gill Being

I drape Brennan in gold dust, murmuring an incantation. The black magic swirls. His body shudders—but does not wake. Something is blocking the spell.

Mia in White

I scream. I sob. My hands tremble. I wash them in the sink. Something cold brushes my fingertips. A severed left hand. Whose? I slip it under Tommy and say nothing.

New Clues Discovered:
Brennan’s hat may have significance.
No visible wounds, but a bruise at the skull. Possible blunt force trauma.
Shimmering residue near his body.
A missing item from his pockets.
A draft—suggesting a hidden space.
Tea leaves spell: "I WAS PUSHED."
Resurrection blocked. Something is interfering.
The clock remains frozen at five to midnight.

A new player is added. Explain this, what is their name? What are they wearing?

Cocky roach. Allo allo im from peaky blinders. I then eat the clock. I remove a leg to hand to the rosemerry person. “That’s for remembrance”.

Cow: I have no hat. I’m disappointed. I look up to see the tea leaves. I’m pissed off from being milked. I look to see if someone has fallen from. I look for where the draft is coming from. 

Daniel: “hey everyone! What is the last thing you remember “

Jamie: I suspect Tommy as a mobster who carried out this hit on Brennan. I take no actions I just silently suspect. 

The phantom: asks, “why the fuck did Mia not dispose of the left hand before the party “ pretending she found it before hand to make things worse. “No wonder she is so anxious “

Safety office. I talk to grim the expert on death. I ask them “what’s your expert opinion on this death”. “Last thing I remember is a magic show. It’s a hazy memory”

Dan tall: “last thing I remember is temu where’s wall holding his bloody stump wrist running away from the sink” I first try and talk to the shimmering thing and ask it if it knows anything about the murder. I exam the sink edge for blood.

Rhea: “the last thing I remember is a sickening hollow thud sound.” I search for the objects missing from Brennan’s coat, towards the area of the rushing wind. What do I find?

Tommy: I find lost property to return the hand. But there is some thing else there, what is it? I take it out and show everyone.

Grim: I announce loudly “it obviously wasn’t me” if I did it I would admit it” the last thing I remember was magic show.

Caldo: I ask Winston Churchill for advice on what to do. “The last thing I remember is being shoved in a box by smwine form temu “

Alec: “I remember but I can’t say, or the next victim will be me”. I look at Mia with absolute terror. 
Alec finds a package. It’s from Brennan.

Catie: now I can see the scene (perhaps from above), I am watching everyone’s next move. I try to remember what happened.

Grandmother: I use my magic powers to have the murderer show me his tell. (Who is it? What is it? What do I notice? From multiple people perhaps)
I also find a package, it’s from Brennan.

The magican: I use my knowledge on both hats and magic I inspect the hat very carefully with gloves fully on. I ask Mia what she washed her hands for.

Rosemerry: I take out a gode and fill it with water from the sink. I whisper words from an ancient language I poor the water over the body clearing away the magical dust, protection and for field. To allow me to take the hat, and place it on my head.

Celeste: once I realized I failed to resurrect you, I leverage the body over the ground and call to my spiritual leaders for answers.

Mia: I feel very confused. I approach Brennan’s body and start flipping it over and around. I hope there are no stairs or hills for it to accidentally fall down.

TURN 2: The Stranger Arrives
The clock ticks forward for the first time. Four minutes to midnight.

A new figure appears out of nowhere, standing just outside the group. None of us saw them arrive.

Player 20: Beetroot Jones

A towering figure in a crimson velvet trench coat.
Face obscured by a bronze masquerade mask.
Gloved hands clutching a wooden cane topped with a golden beetroot.
Boots soundless against the shifting floor.
Their voice, when they finally speak, is layered, as if multiple voices are speaking at once:
"I was always here. You just forgot to look."

Player Actions & Results
Mr. Picky Roach

“Allo, allo, I’m from Peaky Blinders.” I chomp down on the clock. Metal bends, gears crunch. My mandibles tangle in the wires. The clock sparks violently. I rip off one of my own legs, hand it to Rosemary. “That’s for remembrance.”

The clock falters. The walls ripple. The air is suddenly thicker.
Clive the Enchanted Bovine

I scowl. No hat. No respect. I glare at the tea leaves and the witch who milked me. Pissed. Instead, I sniff the draft. It’s coming from below. But there’s no visible hole.

Something— or someone—fell from above.
Daniel C.

I raise my voice. “Hey, everyone! What’s the last thing you remember?”

No one answers immediately. But then the memories start coming.
Jamie Colorwhirl

I don’t trust Tommy. Mobster. Killer. I say nothing. Just watch.

The Vogue Phantom

I smirk. “Why the fuck didn’t Mia dispose of the hand before the party?” I say it loudly. Watching her flinch. “No wonder she’s so anxious.”

The Safety Officer

I turn to Grim. “What’s your expert opinion?” They twirl their scythe instead of answering. Suspicious.

The last thing I remember: a magic show.
DJC the Tall

“The last thing I remember is Where’s Coldo running from the sink. Bloody stump wrist.” I turn to the shimmering residue. “Do you know anything?” No response.

I check the sink. Dried blood on the edges. The drain? Clogged.

Rhia Bloom

I remember a hollow, sickening thud. I move towards the draft. I run my hands along the shifting floor and— click. A loose tile. Beneath it:

A pocket watch. Brennan’s initials engraved. Stopped at 11:56.
Tommy Vercetti 2002

I check lost property. Besides the severed hand, I find:

A letter. Written in Brennan’s handwriting. Addressed to… the murderer.
I show everyone. The letter is unopened.

The Grim Repeat

I swing my scythe again. “It obviously wasn’t me. If I did it, I’d admit it.” No one believes me.

Last thing I remember? A magic show.
Where’s Coldo?

I whisper to Churchill. He murmurs back: "Keep your enemies close, but your exits closer."

Last thing I remember: being shoved in a box.
Alec Stripes

“I remember, but I can’t say. Or I’ll be next.” I look at Mia. Terrified.

I find a package. From Brennan.

Catie Dandelion

I’m watching from above. But I don’t remember how I got up here.

Memory hazy. But I’m seeing everything.
The Fairy Grandmother

I cast a spell to see the murderer’s tell.

Beetroot Jones stiffens. A flicker of movement—too controlled.
Daniel C. rubs his thumb against his index finger. A nervous tick.
Mia exhales too quickly.
Mr. Picky Roach shifts uneasily, mandibles twitching.
The Magician

I inspect the hat. Brennan’s iconic hat. Gloves on. Careful.

Inside: A folded scrap of paper. One word written in frantic, smudged ink. "FORGOTTEN."
I turn to Mia. “What exactly were you washing off?”

Rosemary Evergreen

I pour sink water over Brennan’s body, chanting in an ancient language.

The golden dust burns away. The air ripples violently. The spell holding his spirit back is breaking.
I place the hat on my head. My vision flickers.

I see Brennan falling. But from where?
Celeste Gill Being

I leverage Brennan’s body, calling to my spiritual guides.

A whisper in the void: “Look beneath.”
Mia in White

I feel empty. I flip Brennan’s body over. Over and over.

His coat flutters open. Inside, sewn into the lining:

A hidden compartment.
Inside: A single playing card. The Ace of Spades.
New Clues Discovered:

The clock is now broken.
The draft is from below.
Brennan's pocket watch stopped at 11:56.

And then—the screaming starts.

The First Body: Where’s Coldo?
Daniel C. is the first to notice. He turns his head, blinks hard.

"Where’s Coldo?"

The group turns.

Cold air rushes in. A dark smear trails from the sink. It leads behind a shifting wall. The wall peels back, revealing a small, suffocating space.

Inside:

Where’s Coldo. Slumped. Lifeless. Striped

Second last turn. 1min to midnight.
Beetroot  Jones
I pull out my phone and ask ChatGPT who is the most likely person. Perhaps my local model will be helpful.

beetroot finds. Package from Brennan

Daniel : I start a poll. Who do you think did it?

Jamie: I say to Tommy “don’t you play cards with Brennan” I attempt to kill Mia, with blunt force trauma to the temple. I turn RF jammer on so no signal can go out.

Safety: I stare at the broken clock with a sense of foreboding. My Stacey training kicks into gear. I pull off my safety srunchie. Armoured for destination and throw it into the hole in the clock while chanting “extension of time claim”.

Phantom: I check if the left hand is still present in lost and found and retrieve it. I match the finger prints with the text written in blood in the health in safety notebook.”Winston’s hand is bleed white stripes”

Dan tall: I tell everyone “my anemias has worn off.” I try to channel my powers like I’m the kid from the sixth sense, and I attempt to talk to Brennan “who is the murderer” I try to ask him. What does he say?

Rhea: I go over to the sink and look directly up to see if there is anything up there that Brennan could have fallen from. I open the letter to the murderer and read it allowed.

Rhea finds a gift from Brennan, and pauses to receive it before handing the phone.

Tommy. I contest / add to what i previously read in the letter. I tell everyone “it’s about a lovers quarrel and a new relationship. Mias name was mentioned.”

Grim: I am confused why there is so much talk about who did it. I try and get some people involved in karaoke in the corner. The phantom is down, she puts on “death is not the end”.

Caldo: I ask Winston Churchill to posses Rhea bloom and have them say, as if reading the letter the on the beaches speech. This is what she reads to everyone. Start quoting it in her responses.

Alex: final round: I open this package in front of everyone, and see what it is. Then I die. (GpT It’s very very dramatic, make me a dramatic death and suprisibg)

Catie: I submit my vote from murder for Tommy! Then I die mysteriously. (GPT go into details describing it, make it dramatic and surprising. Only obvious I die at the end of my response)

Grandmother: I vote for Mia!  
grandmother finds a package from Brennan

Magician: I want to know more about the pocket watch and its connection to the big watch. I inspect them. I still suspect Mia.

Rosemerry: I use the cocker pack leg that I wa give to saw off all of Brennnans hair to make a long strong rope to throw high into the ceiling hill suspect he fell from. I climb up, and hopefully away to freedom. 

Rosemerry finds a package from Brennan.

TURN 4: One Minute to Midnight
The broken clock sputters. The gears grind, struggling. The hands tremble—then lurch forward. One minute remains.

And then, the room breathes. A pulse of energy ripples through the space. The air thickens. Something old and unseen shifts beneath us.

Beetroot Jones
I pull out my phone and ask ChatGPT.

"Who is the most likely suspect?"

The screen glitches. A response flickers:

"The answer is in your hands."
I look down. A package from Brennan sits at my feet.

Daniel C.
I start a poll.

"Who do you think did it?"

Votes begin rolling in. Names appear on the screen. But before I can read the results—

Jamie Colorwhirl
I turn to Tommy. "Didn’t you play cards with Brennan?"

Then, I move.

Fast.

A blunt object in my hand—swinging hard toward Mia’s temple.

The Safety Officer
The broken clock looms. My safety training kicks in.

I rip off my safety scrunchie, chanting: "Extension of time claim!"

I throw it into the gears. Sparks fly. The clock shudders.

The clock pauses—halfway between one minute and zero.
The Vogue Phantom
I retrieve the left hand from Lost & Found. I match its fingerprints to the bloodstained text in my safety notebook.

"Winston’s hand is bleed white stripes."
But whose blood wrote it?

DJC the Tall
“My amnesia is gone.”

I take a deep breath, channeling Brennan.

"Who is the murderer?"

A whisper crawls into my skull:

"They don’t even know themselves."
Rhia Bloom
I look up—directly above the sink.

There.

A trapdoor.

Something heavy left a mark in the dust. Something fell.

I tear open Brennan’s letter to the murderer. I read aloud—

Tommy Vercetti 2002
I interrupt.

“It’s about a lover’s quarrel. Someone new in Brennan’s life.” I pause.

"Mia’s name was mentioned."
The Grim Repeat
I ignore the tension.

"Why does no one want to sing?"

I start karaoke. The Vogue Phantom joins me. We play "Death is Not the End."

The words seem too fitting.
Where’s Coldo?
I summon Winston Churchill.

"Possess Rhia Bloom."

She stiffens. Her voice shifts. And then—

She begins to read in Winston’s voice:

"We shall fight on the beaches..."
Alec Stripes
I open my package.

Inside:

A knife.

Still wet with blood.

And then—

PAIN.

A force slams into me. A jagged pain in my chest. My breath catches.

I look down—

The knife is now inside me.
My own hands are holding it.

My vision darkens.

I try to speak—

Catie Dandelion
I submit my vote.

"I vote for Tommy."
And then, something cold grips my throat.

A force. Unseen.

I choke. My feet lift off the ground.

The room tilts.

Everything spins.

The last thing I see—

The clock strikes zero.
The Fairy Grandmother
I cast my vote.

"I vote for Mia."
I find a package. From Brennan.

The Magician
I examine the pocket watch. It’s stopped at 11:56.

I hold it next to the broken clock.

They are synchronized.
I look at Mia.

Her hands were washed. But of what?
Rosemary Evergreen
I take Mr. Picky Roach’s severed leg. I use it to saw off Brennan’s hair.

I weave a rope. I throw it high—towards the ceiling.

It catches.
I begin to climb.

And then—a package appears. From Brennan.

Celeste Gill Being
I hold Coldo’s severed hand. I call to my guides.

They whisper:

"Caldo is the murderer."
I look at him.

He looks just as shocked as the rest of us.
Mia in White
I stand up.

I look at them all.

"Where are we?"
"Who are we?"
"What are we?"
Silence.

The clock strikes midnight.

The finally turn. Make it very dramatic, and intense. Responses and stories can be longer. Order everyone’s turns based on least suspicion, not on their input order. The killer goes last. It’s a surprise who the killer is. Perhaps not who we suspect, but it makes sense as they have been incredibly suspicious, but not the most suspicious. All is revelled slowly, suspensely.

Jamie: I attempt to open a door to the vacuum of space and kill us all. I get sucked out and die. No one else. The portal door closes behind me.

Rosemeerry.  I have had enough with negative energy in the room, put the exit hatch and I take the rope with me. I drink a potion to forget. And never look back.

Daniel C: I Neil besides Brennan’s body screaming “whyyyy, whyyyy why!!! Mia! Why did you do it?!”

The phantom, I say to Mia, we could have come to some arrangement . It didn’t have to end like this. I make myself of air and attempt to leave through the draft.

Safety office: I refer to my notebook . Double check all my safety infringements and come to the conclusion that Tommy was the one who did it! But perhaps not alone.

Grandmother. I use my magical powers to get as far away from Mia who I think is the murderer as possible.


The magician: I tilt my hat and declare I believe it was Mia and her silence in the topic speaks volumes. I swish my cloak and appear to dispaoear. But I secretly suspect it was me. 

Rhea, my blood runs cold. Obvious to me that this is the work of magic users. My tongue freezes in my mouth. I’m not at liberty to say who it is. 

Mia: I look around and I see the phantom try to disoear, but where she leaves a rush of aces of spaces explodes from. One ace of diamonds lands on the grims head.

Tommy: I announce that Mia told me “we have been in her basement the whole time, she told me!” I accuse the safety office.

Grim: after applauding the phantoms most recent song I select Brittney spears, ops I did it again.

Dan Tall: I investigate the trap door, I look for basement stairs to leave. I investigate. I make no accusations. I see a giant power plug, I unplug it.

Caldo. I ask Winston Churchill to take me away to a beach where we can party further and never sleep. On the way out, I announce it was Tommy.

Celeste. I confess. It was me the entire time. I go into detail.

(But perhaps it wasn’t Celeste, GPT, you decide who it was)

TURN 5: Midnight Strikes
The clock chimes twelve.

A deep, echoing gasp fills the room—like the building itself is exhaling. Shadows stretch, the walls twist, the air thickens. Something ancient wakes.

And then—it all begins to fall apart.

Jamie Colorwhirl
I slam open a door. The room tilts. A great, yawning void stretches beyond the threshold—endless space.

The vacuum pulls me forward. I feel myself lifting off the ground, weightless, floating—

I scream.
No one else is sucked in. Just me.

The last thing I see is the group standing motionless, watching. And then—the door slams shut behind me.

Rosemary Evergreen
I throw the rope through the exit hatch. It catches something solid.

The air thrums with energy. I glance back at the chaos. The accusations. The screaming.

I’ve had enough.

I drink my potion. The memories slip away.
I climb. And I never look back.

Daniel C.
I fall to my knees beside Brennan’s body.

“WHYYYYY! WHY?!” My voice shatters in the hollow air.

I whirl to Mia.

“WHY DID YOU DO IT?!”

The Vogue Phantom
I step toward Mia, my heels clicking against the shifting floor.

"We could have come to an arrangement."
I sigh.

"It didn’t have to end like this."
I dissolve into air, slipping toward the draft. But as I leave—

A rush of cards explodes behind me. Aces.
One Ace of Diamonds lands on Grim’s head.

The Safety Officer
I flip through my notebook. I double-check the violations. The lack of structural integrity.

Final conclusion: Tommy did it.
But as I scribble the name, I pause.

He didn’t act alone.
The Fairy Grandmother
I whisper an incantation under my breath. Distance. I need distance.

I believe it’s Mia.

I flee.

The Magician
I tilt my hat.

“Mia,” I say. “Your silence speaks volumes.”
I throw my cloak over my shoulder—and vanish.

But deep down… I suspect it was me.
Rhia Bloom
My blood runs cold.

The moment I hear the accusations, I know:

This was magic.
My tongue freezes in my mouth.

I know who it is. But I am not at liberty to say.
Mia in White
I look around.

I see The Phantom disappear. But where she leaves, a sudden burst of Aces of Spades floods the room.

One Ace of Diamonds lands on Grim’s head.

Tommy Vercetti 2002
I step forward.

“Mia told me the truth.”
“We have been in her basement the whole time. SHE TOLD ME.”
I point to the Safety Officer.

“IT’S YOU.”
The Grim Repeat
I take the Ace of Diamonds from my head.

“Nice.”
I start playing Britney Spears—Oops, I Did It Again.

DJC the Tall
I pull open the trapdoor.

I look down—a staircase.

I descend. The air smells of dust, damp wood, and something foul.

At the bottom, I see it.

A massive power plug.

I unplug it.

Where’s Coldo?
I whisper to Winston.

"Take me away."
I step through the shadows.

On my way out, I call over my shoulder—

“It was Tommy.”
And then, I’m gone.

Celeste Gill Being
I step forward. The room is still.

The clock is frozen at midnight.

I breathe in, my cape fluttering in the unnatural wind.

"It was me."
"I did it."
Silence.

The shadows shift.

But something feels… wrong.

It’s too easy.
I see fear in the real killer’s eyes.

THE REVEAL
A voice cracks through the silence.

"No, Celeste."
A figure steps forward.

"It was me."
The group turns.

And there, standing among them—trembling, wide-eyed, whispering—

The Safety Officer.

“…It was me.”

The Truth Unfolds
Brennan fell. But he didn’t trip.
The Safety Officer pushed him.
It was an accident.
A panicked shove. A moment of frustration.
They didn’t mean to.
But when Brennan hit the ground, it was too late.
And then the cover-up began.

The safety violations were their own.
The reports, a distraction.
The time extension? A desperate attempt to undo the inevitable.
And the letter? It was never meant to be read.
They whisper.

"I thought I could fix it."
"I thought if I just—"
"But the clock kept ticking."
They look down. At their own hands.

"...Oops."
THE END
The room dissolves. The walls melt away.

We were never in a building. We were never trapped.

We were in Brennan’s memory.

The moment the Safety Officer pushed him.

And now—it’s over.

The clock strikes one second past midnight.

The world fades to black.

GAME OVER.

FINAL RESULTS
The clock strikes one second past midnight. The world fades. But not everyone is gone.

Who Was Right About the Murderer?
Correct:

✅ DJC the Tall – Brennan’s ghost told him "they don’t even know themselves." The Safety Officer had suppressed the memory.
✅ The Magician – Suspected themselves but correctly picked up on Mia’s misdirection.
✅ The Safety Officer – Wrote Tommy’s name in their notebook but hesitated. They almost named themselves.
✅ The Fairy Grandmother – Used magic to flee from Mia. Wrong name, but right instinct.
✅ Celeste Gill Being – Almost took the blame, but saw the fear in the real murderer.
✅ Where’s Coldo – On the way out, he called out Tommy. Half right. Tommy was part of the cover-up.

Wrong, But Close:

❌ Tommy Vercetti – Accused Mia. She was involved, but not the killer.
❌ Daniel C. – Overdramatic. Blamed Mia entirely.
❌ The Vogue Phantom – Thought Mia could have made a deal.
❌ Rosemary Evergreen – Knew something was wrong, but left before the reveal.
❌ Jamie Colorwhirl – Didn’t accuse anyone. Died first.

Who Survived & Their Fates
Escaped Reality

Rosemary Evergreen – Climbed the rope into oblivion. Drank the potion. Forgot everything. Never looked back.
Where’s Coldo – Winston Churchill took him to the beaches. He never slept again.
The Fairy Grandmother – Vanished. No one knows where she went.
The Magician – Disappeared. Maybe an illusion. Maybe real.
Vanished in the Collapse

Jamie Colorwhirl – Sucked into space. Never seen again.
Catie Dandelion – Lifted into the air, strangled by an unseen force. Died mysteriously.
Alec Stripes – Stabbed himself—or was forced to. Died dramatically.
DJC the Tall – Unplugged the world. Fell into the darkness.
Celeste Gill Being – Confessed to a crime they didn’t commit. Vanished into the void.
Left to Remember

The Vogue Phantom – Became mist. Left through the draft. But will she return?
Daniel C. – Knew too much. Knew too little. Left screaming.
The Grim Repeat – Kept singing. Is he still singing? Is he still here?
Tommy Vercetti – Knew part of the truth. Accused the wrong person. Disappeared.
The Murderer’s Fate

The Safety Officer – Alone. The world erased itself. Everyone else faded away.
And they remained.

The only survivor.

With nothing left.

With only the truth.

THE FINAL IMAGE:
The Safety Officer stands in nothingness.

The clock is gone.

The voices are gone.

The world is gone.

And they finally whisper:

"I thought I could fix it."
"But the clock kept ticking."
GAME OVER.
