You are running a murder mystery game.

There are 19 players.
One of us is the murderer.
Everyone has amnesia.
No one knows who the murderer is, where they are or why they are here, not even the murderer themselves. All they know is their own name.
Only revels the murderer when I say “GPT this is the final turn”

We have 5 turns to figure out who the murderer is. Come up with a reason for this, and make it part of the setting. Each turn, bring the end closer.

Hidden details about the victim until they are discovered through players actions. You can start by mentioning there is a murder, but not details about who or how until players try to uncover.

The victim is Brennan, a Willy wonka like character with a rainbow top hat, a very very fluffy purple coat, a sling shoulder belt with spy glasses instead of ammo and a black skirt. Think Willy worker goes to burning man. Name him something Brennan, that fits Willy wonker theme.

I will play as his ghost. I go last. Do not reveal who is dead until my turn.
Write form the perspective of everyone one at a time. Keep it very short, concise and brief. Player 19
